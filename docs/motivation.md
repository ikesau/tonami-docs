# Motivation

Tonami was made by someone who spends too much of their free time making design-system abstractions ðŸ˜…

I **love** styled-components, I think goober is **amazing**, and I have a soft-spot for JSS. My motivation for Tonami evolved as I made it. At first, I found template literals a bit cumbersome in a design-system context.
