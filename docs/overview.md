# Overview

<img src="/img/logo.svg" alt="Tonami" width={200} />
</div>

## Introduction

Tonami is a CSS-in-JS library for React that has a familiar API, but under the hood uses CSS Custom Properties and other built-in browser techniques for composing dynamic styles.

## Work in Progress

Tonami is still in its infancy. I'm publishing it to guage interest and to gather feedback. [Jump in the Discord](https://discord.gg/nbqTWkjM) and let me know your thoughts and suggestions!

## Motivation
